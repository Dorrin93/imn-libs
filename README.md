# IMN Libs  

C++ libraries with numerical methods, based on lecture "Inzynierskie Metody Numeryczne" (Engineering Numerical Methods).  
AGH University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, 2014/2015.  
Lecture taught by prof. Bartlomiej Szafran.
  
More info in pdf files in each directory.  
Materials are not mine, I have only implemented methods.  
All pdfs downloaded from [here](http://galaxy.agh.edu.pl/~dzebrow/).  

**Project progres:** about 28%

## Already implemented:  
1. Implicit and explicit differential equasions  
4. Viscous flow  
  
## Not implemented:  
2. Iterative differential equasions  
3. Potential flow  
5. 2D advection  
6. Diffusion equasion (heat transfer)  
7. Wave equasion  
  
## Eventual future improvements:  
* GUI utilizing PyQt (extending python with C++) and Gnuplot  
* Parallelization of possible algorithms
