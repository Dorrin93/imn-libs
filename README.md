# IMN Libs  

C++ libraries with numerical methods, based on lecture "Inzynierskie Metody Numeryczne" (Engineering Numerical Methods).  
AGH University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science, 2014/2015.  
Lecture taught by prof. Bartlomiej Szafran.  
  
Libraries uses C++11 (and possibly some C++14) features, so make sure you have suitable compiler. Code is documented in
doxygen style, main.cpp file shows example usage of library.
  
More info in pdf files in each directory.  
Materials are not mine, I have only implemented methods.  
All pdfs downloaded from [here](http://galaxy.agh.edu.pl/~dzebrow/).  

**Project progres:** about 70%

## Already implemented:  
1. Implicit and explicit differential equasions  
2. Iterative differential equasions  
3. Potential flow
4. Viscous flow 
7. Wave equasion  
  
## Not implemented:  
5. 2D advection  
6. Diffusion equasion (heat transfer)  
  
## Eventual future improvements:  
* GUI utilizing PyQt (extending python with C++) and Gnuplot  
* Parallelization of possible algorithms
