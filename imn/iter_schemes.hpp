     * Function similar to Point relaxation, but algorithm assumes calculating grid every k*dx or k*dy values instead
     * of dx or dy. Then, k is divided by two and grid is calculated once again, k is divided etc. That allows to decrease
     * general interation amount.

     * @param file Output file stream we will write integral. May be open or closed.
     * If closed, it will be open with default name containing omega factor, and then closed.
